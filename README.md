<h1>React Native App for Indian Farmers</h1>
This is a mobile application designed to help Indian farmers with their farming activities. The app is designed to be cross-platform and has been developed for both Android and iOS operating systems. The application is integrated with the sensors and machine learning model developed by the team to provide the best possible advice and support to farmers.

<h2>Features</h2> 

* Crop Health Monitoring: The app allows farmers to monitor the health of their crops in real-time. Farmers who have purchased sensors can view live graphs of their crops from any location in the world.

* Machine Learning Model: The app contains a machine learning model that can provide the best course of action for farmers based on the NPK values of their crops.

* Customer Service Form: The app includes a customer service form that farmers can use to submit questions or issues to the team. The team will upload these questions to an online server and provide answers or solutions.

* Public Forum: The app includes a public forum where farmers can discuss the best farming methods and area-specific issues. The forum also provides location-specific updates such as weather updates.

<h2>Installation</h2>
You can clone the repository and build the app from the source code. Run "npm install" to install all libraries and run through expo by using "npx expo start".

<h2>Usage</h2>
Once you have installed the app, you can use it to monitor the health of your crops, get advice from the machine learning model, and submit questions or issues to the team. You can also use the public forum to discuss farming methods and area-specific issues with other farmers.
